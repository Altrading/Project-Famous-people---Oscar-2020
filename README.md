SQL Project: Famous people - Oscar 2020

Khan Academy Project: Famous people - Oscar 2020

In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.

For example, here are types of famous people and the questions your data could answer:

Movie stars: What movies are they in? Are they married to each other?
Singers: What songs did they write? Where are they from?
Authors: What books did they write?
Fictional characters: How are they related to other characters? What books do they show up in?

I choosed to use data from list of Oscar nominees 2020

https://oscar.go.com/nominees

And public information about actors and movies from 

https://www.imdb.com/

Interesting fact: 
1) Only Joaquin Phoenix has no one related project with another lead or supporting nominees.

2) You can connected all of actors (Oscar nominees 2020) except Joaquin Phoenix trought 14 joint movies.
